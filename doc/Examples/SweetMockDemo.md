# Sweet mock demo 

## Creating mocks 

Create a mock object by using the static Mock factory, using the method with the same name as the Mock you want to create.
The method returns an instance of an object matching the interface or base class.
Mocks are configured using the config parameter that takes a lambda exposing a fluent interface.

```csharp
// Arrange
var mock = Mock.IDemoDependency(config =>
{
    config.StringProperty("Initial value");
});

// ACT
var actual = mock.StringProperty;
mock.StringProperty = "New value";

// Assert
Assert.Equal("Initial value", actual);
Assert.Equal("New value", mock.StringProperty);
```

Mocks can also be created directly by calling new MockOf_{class name}(). This is not recommended.
