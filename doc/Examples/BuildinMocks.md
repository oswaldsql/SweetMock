# Buildin mocks 

## Buildin mock for i logger 

Sets up a test environment for a class with an  dependency.
This method uses the SweetMock library to create and configure a mock for the 
and provides testing capabilities related to log messages logged by the dependent class.
The test fixture is created for the `ClassWithILoggerDependency` and the logging level
is set to `LogLevel.Trace`. The method tests log outputs by invoking the
`WriteToTheLog` method and retrieves all logged messages for verification.
This method enables validation of log message content, log levels, and overall logging behavior
within a controlled environment using mocked dependencies.

```csharp
var fixture = Fixture.ClassWithILoggerDependency(
    config => config.logger.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Trace) // Default is <c>LogLevel.Information</c>
);
var sut = fixture.CreateClassWithILoggerDependency();

sut.WriteToTheLog();

var logs = fixture.Calls.logger;

var actualCriticalLog = Assert.Single(logs.Log(arguments => arguments.logLevel == LogLevel.Critical));
// Do some assertions.

var allLogs = logs.Log();
foreach (var log in allLogs)
{
    Console.WriteLine(log.message);
}
```

If loglevel should be `LogLevel.Information` the config section can be removed.
